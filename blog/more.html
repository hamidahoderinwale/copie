        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p>I'm hesitant to say these are projects, but I can't think of a better name.</p>

        <h4>Lit. Reviews</h4>
        <p>Sometimes I do informal literature reviews, mainly for fun, or as the starting point for research projects. Because a lot of them are ongoing, most of them are tucked away, but here's the ones I've made public. I'll also add other things here later, too.</p>

            <ul><a href="https://www.bettertrajectories.org/">Better Trajectories</a></ul> | I ran a microgrants program and did some Math Olympiad outreach. I didn't do Math Olympiads in high school. But, economists did cool <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20190457">research</a> on them. I help out West African teams (n=1.5), so reach out if you think I can be of help.  </ul>
            <p>With support from <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures">Emergent Ventures</a> I wanted to carry some of the ethos of that program to a region that felt overlooked and I cared about.</p>
            <ul><a href="https://www.hsopportunities.com/">HS Opportunities Board </a> | I don't mantain this anymore. But, here's another (better) <a href="https://github.com/nayafia/microgrants">list</a>. </ul>
