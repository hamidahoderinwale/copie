        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p>I'm hesitant to say these are projects, but I can't think of a better name.</p>

        <h4>Lit. Reviews</h4>
        <p>Sometimes I do informal literature reviews, mainly for fun, or as the starting point for research projects. Because a lot of them are ongoing, most of them are tucked away, but here's the ones I've made public.</p>
        <div class="projectlist">
            <ul><a href="https://morefromresearch.pubpub.org/pub/8o5s2ro4/release/13" target="_blank">Data Provenance & ML Reproducibility.</a> 7K words and counting of FAFO, productively (?). The researchers interested in this sort of thing have been super accessible. Thanks to everyone I've spoken to (RT @ Astera, DA @ Columbia, HH @ the University of Amsterdam, and others :) </ul>

            <ul><a href="https://www.bettertrajectories.org/" target="_blank">Better Trajectories</a></ul> With support from <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures">Emergent Ventures</a>, I ran a microgrants program and did some Math Olympiad outreach. I didn't do Math Olympiads in high school. But, economists did cool <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20190457" target="_blank">research</a> on them. I help out West African teams (n=1.5), so reach out if you think I can be of help.  </ul>

            <ul><a href="https://www.hsopportunities.com/" target="_blank">HS Opportunities Board </a> I don't mantain this anymore. But, here's another (better) <a href="https://github.com/nayafia/microgrants">list</a>. </ul>
