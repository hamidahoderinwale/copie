<h2>Get Good and Copy</h2>
<p><i>August 2, 2024</i></p>
<p>While these essays may be stylistic, maybe even “good.” There’s another dimension to this goodness, that we seek, that shows itself when we have ideas to share, or rather when we’re trying to sell them. Ideas can be things that you want to sell and just like any commodity; presentation matters, but maybe even more importantly, so does function. To sharpen my tools, I thought to myself that I had to be a cracked writer. I needed to one day be capable of moving man to tears at cultural revolution’s notice. Beyond basic grammar, which I would have to refresh, and beyond meeting deadlines, I had to actually try and improve and get good.</p>
    
<p>Here’s how we’re doing it.</p>

<p>First, I had to learn the practice of intentionality. With my blog, the goal is pretty much prosaic journal entries. Ramblings. I cache my thoughts on this ever-evolving site, and excitingly I have enough content on here, that I now can come back and read them. I also have friends that read these posts and we’ll talk about them; and, people who I don’t know or have recently come to know can come to this site can get a free peek into my soul, be affirmed that I have one, which is nice. Regardless, because I come back to these posts, they should be enjoyable for her, or my future self, to read.</p>

<p>The heuristic for style is to write as you speak. I write like my most polished self speaks, keeping the quirks of my personality, playing with language, rhythm, and the freedom of this site. Or, at least I try.</p>

<p>Beyond a blog, let’s discuss policy writing. I'm still not great at this. My first piece definitely made me very okay with a river of colored strikes and comments that went well past the end of the document. Santi, the beloved, helped a lot. I also should have read the Style guide, much, much sooner. At IFP my main output, or at least I think, has been coming up with some idea, doing a kind of crude literature review, and then turning that into something readable and useful. My audience is a congressional staffer, and more frankly, the internet—we love a Twitter thread piece drop. I was at the UK Day One Project and anchored to the writings of the FAS Day One Project, but they wanted stand-alone pieces, which makes sense, the proposals were their core output—no context was to be assumed—that was something I learned. I got critical, but good feedback and it led to the spree of improvement that I put upon myself for the summer.</p>

<p>For more academic writing, I think my approach is best described as taking the essence of the two types of writing above and throwing up whatever that comes out to be. In academic writing, we communicate findings and insights. So, honestly, if the time comes to write up results for an experiment or study, and our starting point are a set of terse bullet points—then what tends to work pretty well is prepending a few transition words, throwing in motivations for certain choices, and defining terms. Oh, and don’t forget the active voice. To add, I will say that I have read some really nice papers and there appears to be a lot of intention and creative liberty the researchers seem to take, but for a noob like myself; there’s still a formula that seems, or has been, pretty tractable to crack.</p>

<p>Okay, so now for the question of the night, how did I get better? Or rather, how am I trying to. So there’s a less systematic approach to this, it’s more virtuous, maybe more principled—in it, I just elusively read a lot and write more—but let’s throw that away for a minute. I needed structure, I needed results: I need structure, and I need results. A “training plan” would come from an article on this site called the <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/want-to-become-a-better-writer-copy-the-work-of-others/" target="_blank">Art of Manliness</a>: they propose a straightforward intervention—copying. Yes, copying. Like grabbing a sheet of paper or an iPad, or whatever, and then just copying what is written in front of you. As straightforward as this is, there are still some unknowns. One, what do I copy? Two, when do I stop? In response to the first question, I realized that attempting to answer this question was a good practice in itself. I love Substack, I’m quite chronically online, but to crack this code, you need to go to works that were written by people who wanted to make artifacts. It feels weird to write this as motivation because it takes some feeling of self-importance to admit, but for me, I think it’s been an interesting mindset to care about what I leave behind, and respecting it as such. It wouldn’t make sense to copy people who were writing essays in the same vein that I write on my blog. I learned this pretty late. I hit up the classics, there’s no shame, I know there's no shame, but it’s questionable this wasn’t my first instinct. I copied papers that I was reading for projects, paid special attention to the charm of the author, if I’d heard their name before, etc. I relied on imperfect, but still pretty solid heuristics. Lawyers write well, I think, so I copied them too.</p>

<p>With this, there’s some genuineness that I really care about, that this “training plan” seems to toss away. But when I come to think of it, the first question is once again really important, and helps to remedy what seems to be lost. Because in choosing who to copy, or imitate: authors in this S-tier, I still have choice. And it is still up to me and my taste to lead the way: I don’t have all the time in the world so I have to choose one author over the other. And in trying to imitate, my new style is the blend of these people that I admire—based on taste that is pretty unique to me. I lightly subscribe to the combinatorial theory of innovation, where we describe novel invention as just a mixture of what preceded it, and so this means that this approach doesn’t mean you lose artistic integrity, in fact, you still get to produce something new.</p>

<p>There was an ego loss here, in pursuing this training plan, where I realized I couldn’t trust my intuition for what was good. Beyond school I never really dug into the classics to realize why they were as revered as they were. I didn’t have a reading habit until lately, so I kind of internalized that everyone was faking it. But, now when I read, more frequently at that, I have another dimension to notice: the sentences, the cadence, the vernacular and I just think books are cool for the whole prosperous artificial spiel. Anyway, to start I just deferred. I didn’t rely on what I thought was good, I scouted out what others thought were good, listened to that. This deferrance was probably the largest source of improvement, slowly, I could delineate things that were better written than others, whereas before they would all be “good.”</p>

<p>With this, this post isn’t necessarily an invitation for you, my dear reader, to give your takes on my written evolution, but I don’t mind! While, this blog will likely indefinitely remain a home to my ramblings, I’d like to think they’re better structured now. I think copying other people, blatantly, and honestly painfully—as you can maybe imagine, it can get pretty boring doing the near-equivalent of elementary-school busy work—but, it did mean that I have a working (natural) repository of phrases, openers, paragraph structures that come up at space-bars notice which is quite nice. I feel like I spend less time trying to get the words, and to a lesser extent, trying to get them right—the latter will always be an effort, but an easier one at that!</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>So yes, the biggest takeaway is do the unsexy things to improve, copy a lot. Honestly, this post is (kind of) troll. I think the whole copying hundreds of words a day was surprisingly effective. The whole, how do I say this thing and fumbling over the indecision has begun melting away. I can be faster which is good, but yeah I don’t sound like this, it’s important to step out of the frame though, and I think the whole copying schtick, is really good. Anyway, byeeee.</p>
