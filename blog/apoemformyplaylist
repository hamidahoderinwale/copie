   <p>Something to keep for my heart.</p>
        <p>It's all in an effort to feel something, be something.</p>
        <p>And because of it, we always need something, want something.</p>
        <p>Maybe it's not worth it to try...but it's all I've ever known.</p>
        <p>Whispers, tears, songs and cries.</p>
        <p>Wishes, prayers, and heartbeats.</p>
