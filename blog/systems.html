    <h1>CompSys</h1>
    <p>- This is the summer of getting good at Systems, and my internship on a data engineering team is underway. I want to devote myself to learning a lot on my own. <a href="https://www.ekzhang.com/">Eric Zhang's</a> reading group <a href="https://notes.ekzhang.com/events/nysrg">syllabus</a> looks great. Each session is reasonably self-contained, so I should be able to hop around. <a href="https://siboehm.com/">Simon Boehm's</a> blog is also great.</p>
    <p>- When this all started. I was vaguely interested in "interoperability." I latched on to the science, meta-science, and data the process produces. The US Year of Open Science was cool, but work was to be done.</p>
    <p>- Interoperability is a Computer Systems word. Data is field-agnostic. ML is hot. ML is significant. And then the rabbit holes began. I have written takes on specializing foundation models, and while I'm less optimistic than most on certain things, I think there is good work to be done on data management and optimization.</p>
    <p>- This is something I care about less, but I feel like systems aren't that sexy lmao. Maybe that's why I like it. Discreteness. Nodes. Number go up, Number go down. Fast. It's optimization. It's economics. All roads lead back to economics.</p>
    <p>- A field to dedicate myself to. Can't really think of it. But I like things being better. I like things being useful. I like spotting peculiar things, knowing I'm well behind the curve, but adjacent knowledge is cool. It's fun to apply. I can chase the feeling and probably be okay.</p>
