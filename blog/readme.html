    <p>**Quick facts** - I'm Canadian (born and raised in the GTA). - I'm around 5'9. I don't know/remember my official height, but this will do. - I'm Nigerian and Ivorian. - My only party trick is I can (try to) freestyle (yes, the rapping kind)...it's pretty fun.</p>

    <p>**Being in school** Currently, I'm a student at McGill. I'm also an Amazon Future Engineer scholar, which is the leading factor in my decision to study CS. I experimented with discipline affiliations (cough, cough economics), but honestly, I see university to be competent enough in the fundamentals to play with different interests - staying grounded in understanding through projects. I have a deep appreciation for economics, but the field has significant differences in epistemology from physics, math and philosophy and they seem reasonable to understand, too. Being taught by professors is underrated, self-studying is hard to do well, and I have a lot to learn lol.</p>
    
    <p>I didn't come in with as much intention as I would have liked, but maybe this was good. I've generally been letting the wind take me where it does, but hopefully, I have more energy to be intentional in the following semester.</p>

    <p>An excerpt from something I wrote a little while ago: > I'll say the clich&eacute; thing and posit that it isn't in inertness that you grow. I don't have a perfectly articulable value system, and it arguably seems dope to have one, right? Certainty. A quick response time when someone questions your &quot;why&quot;.</p>
    
    <p>> I wake up from my slumber and ask myself what can I do today to save the billions of suffering shrimp. Hard-work, and it's not for the weak, but one must do what has to be done.</p>
    
    <p>> Yeah, like no. I want to help people, make sure that (relatively) lucking out wasn't in vain, put the energy spent on empathy to better use, do the rationally altruistic thing and give away my surplus.</p>
    
    <p>>I'm glory-seeking and part of me just wants to be great; connection-seeking and wants to find my people; knowledge-seeking and wants to understand the complexities of the world that I merely accept without question. But, I have no clue what all this boils down too.&#160;</p>
    
    <p>>You optimize because you identify this optimum and it only makes sense you put all your might into getting as close to it as possible. But, I'm dumb. Sure, there's local optima and I work for those, but it seems quite wrong to try for any given thing.&#160;</p>
    
    <p>>.... Work hard and have no clue what you're doing. It's fine. I accept it as a means to personhood. To the extent I have executive function, I&#160;_try_&#160;to complete the tasks on my to-do list while still being the person that stroll the streets until dawn.</p>
    
    <p>>I let it go. I tried to let whatever it was go, and the plot actually started to get good. Maybe it should have happened sooner, but hey, a drawn-out start is a novel classic.</p>
