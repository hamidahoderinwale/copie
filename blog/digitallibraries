            Something that stays deep in my mind is that I live in an age where I can find things. It’s a wonder for an accepted but insane feat: having instant access to the entire corpora of codified knowledge. This means that I feel a duty to explore it as much as I can while I can. It means I question the balance between consuming and contributing to it. It also means that I think about how it will transform, knowing that we’re only at a cliff of a vast, endless pool of what it can be.
